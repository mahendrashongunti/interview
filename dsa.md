   - Practice calculating the time and space complexity of different algorithms and code snippets.

3. **Deep Dive into Data Structures**:

   - Understand the implementation and operations of various data structures.
   - Practice implementing data structures from scratch and performing operations on them.

4. **Study Sorting and Searching Algorithms**:

   - Learn popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.
   - Understand searching algorithms like Linear Search, Binary Search, and their variations.

5. **Graph Algorithms**:

   - Study graph representations (adjacency matrix, adjacency list) and basic graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS).
   - Learn about algorithms for shortest paths (Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm) and minimum spanning trees (Prim's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm).

6. **Dynamic Programming**:
